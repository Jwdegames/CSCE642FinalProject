CSCE 642 Deep Reinforcement Learning Final Project - Multi-Agent vs Single-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning In A MOBA Game

This project pits a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (MAHRL) architecture against Single-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (SAHRL) architecture in Derk's Gym. One team is has three players each controlled by a separate MAHRL agent while another team has all three players controlled by a single SAHRL agent. 

Note: Game Environment is Dirk's Gym and belongs to Fredrik Nor√©n, Mount Rouke. Find more info here: https://gym.derkgame.com/license \
